<p align="center"><img src="assets/capston01_1.png" width="600" target="_blank"/></p>

### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites
You will need the following software to run the financial calculators:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

#### Installation
To get started with the financial calculators, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cwchan0212/finalCapstone.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd finalCapstone/capstone_01/
```

3. Run the finance_calculator.py file:

```sh
python finance_calculator.py
```

### Usage

#### Investment Calculator 
The investment calculator allows the user to calculate the future value of their investment based on the amount of deposit (i.e. initial principal), annual interest rate, and the number of years. 

To use the investment calculator, follow the prompts in the command line interface (CLI).

|---|---|
|    |   |

#### Home Loan Repayment Calculator
The home loan repayment calculator allows the user to calculate the monthly repayment amount based on the loan principal, interest rate, and loan term.
(Here is the generalised idea)

To use the home loan repayment calculator, follow the prompts in the CLI.

```py
ef home_loan_repayment_calculator():
  # Prompt the user for the present value of the house (i.e. loan principal)
  present_value_of_the_house = float(input("Please enter the PRESENT VALUE OF THE HOUSE: "))

  # Prompt the user for the interest rate
  interest_rate = float(input("Please enter the number of INTEREST RATE: "))

  # Prompt the user for the loan term (in months)
  number_of_months = int(input("Please enter the number of MONTH(S) you plan to take to repay the bond: "))

  # Calculate the monthly repayment amount
  amount = round(((interest_rate/100)/12) * present_value_of_the_house / (1 - math.pow((1 + ((interest_rate/100)/12)), (-number_of_months))), 2)

  # Print the result
  print(f"\nThe monthly repayment amount} is R {amount} at {interest_rate} %.")
```

### Using the Task Manager
To use the task manager, follow the prompts in the command line interface (CLI).

#### Login
The user will be prompted to enter a username and password. A list of valid usernames and passwords is stored in the user.txt file. If the user enters an invalid username or password, an error message will be displayed and the user will be prompted to try again.

#### Menu
Once the user has successfully logged in, they will be presented with the following menu:

```
Please select one of the following options:

r - Register user (admin only)
a - Add task
va - View all tasks
vm - View my tasks
vs - View statistics (admin only)
e - Exit
```

- **Add Task:** The user will be prompted to enter the username of the person the task is assigned to, the title of the task, a description of the task, and the due date of the task. The task will be added to the tasks.txt file.
- **View Tasks:** The user can view a list of all tasks or filter the list to view only their tasks.
- **Register User:** Only the user with the username admin is allowed to register new users. The user will be prompted to enter a new username and password. The user will also be asked to confirm the password. If the value entered to confirm the password matches the value of the password, the username and password will be written to the user.txt file in the appropriate format.
- **Statistics:** The user with the username admin can view statistics about the tasks and users in the task manager. The total number of tasks and the total number of users will be displayed in a user-friendly manner.
- **Quit:** The user can exit the task manager program.
